## Evolutionary Algorithm for the LightUp problem

This is the solution to assignment 1, part b of the course [Introduction to Evolutionary Computing](http://bonsai.auburn.edu/dtauritz/courses/ec/intro/2020fall/) taught by [Dr. Daniel Tauritz](https://bonsai.auburn.edu/dtauritz/) at Auburn University. This repository is an evolutionary algorithm implementation for the lightup problem. The problem statement and the format of the solution are explained in the PDF file.
